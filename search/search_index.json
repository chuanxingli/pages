The complete Integrative Dysregulated Network with dynamic layout and searchable gene names and functions in HTML format. The integrative dysregulated network is a directed network from miRNA (red nodes) to mRNA (blue nodes), mRNA to protein (yellow nodes) or from miRNA to protein (see legend at right). Nodes with red, blue and yellow borders represent miRNA, mRNA and protein respectively. Nodes in rectangles are annotated COPD-related genes from the disease database search (details of descriptions in Supplementary Table S2). Nodes\u2019 sizes correspond to their Bottleneck values in the network. Red and blue edges indicated increased and decreased coexpression between COPD and Smokers, respectively. The network can be easily enlarged or reduced. After clicking on a node, the clicked node and its connected nodes are highlighted, and the left part of the network is in greyed out. There are two ways to search this network: \u201cSelect by id\u201d for gene names, and \u201cSelect by group\u201d for function terms. The searchable function terms correspond to the enriched functions in Table S5. Created with the igraph and visNetwork package in R.

Makes it easy to understand what the file is and what it contains, from just reading the file name Machine readable \u2013 Avoid spaces, deliberate punctuation, accented or odd characters, inconsistent letter casing Default ordered \u2013 Put something numeric first, use the ISO 8601 standard for dates (YYYYMMDD, or YYYY-MM-DD), left pad single digits with zeros (01, 02, 03\u2026 10) In practise: Balance the amount of elements: too many makes it difficult to understand vs. too few makes it generic ( Human readable ) Order elements from general to specific ( Human readable ) Use meaningful abbreviations ( Human readable ) Replace whitespace with underscore (_), hyphen (-) or capitalized letters to separate elements in the name. Avoid using special characters: ?!& , * % # ; * ( ) @$ ^ ~ \u2018 { } [ ] < > ( Machine readable ) Use date format ISO8601: YYYYMMDD, and time if needed HHMMSS, or in combination YYYYMMDD:HHMMSS ( Machine readable ) Include a version number if appropriate ( Human readable ) Write your file naming convention down and explain abbreviations in your data documentation ( Human readable ) Examples of good file names : Honeybee project, experiment 2 done in Helsinki, data file created on the second of December 2020 File name : 20201202_HB_EXP2_HEL_DATA_V03.xls Explanation : Time_ProjectAbbreviation_ExperimentNumber_ Location_TypeOfData_VersionNumber Cropped image of an ant head taken on the third of December 2020 by Meg Megson File name : 20201203_MM_HEAD_CROPPED_V1.psd Explanation : Time_CreatorData_TypeModification_Version Metadata \u00b6 A good and informative file name is a great start, but there is a limit to how much information you can pack into a file name before the length itself becomes a problem. This is where metadata comes in. For the purpose of findability we can associate the file name with metadata stored elsewhere, for example in a text file kept together with the files.
