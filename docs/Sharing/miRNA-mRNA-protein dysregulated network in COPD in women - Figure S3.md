**miRNA-mRNA-protein dysregulated network in COPD in women** 
**Figure S3**. The complete Integrative Dysregulated Network with dynamic layout and searchable gene names and functions in HTML format. The integrative dysregulated network is a directed network from miRNA (red nodes) to mRNA (blue nodes), mRNA to protein (yellow nodes) or from miRNA to protein (see legend at right). Nodes with red, blue and yellow borders represent miRNA, mRNA and protein respectively. Nodes in rectangles are annotated COPD-related genes from the disease database search (details of descriptions in Supplementary Table S2). Nodes’ sizes correspond to their Bottleneck values in the network. Red and blue edges indicated increased and decreased coexpression between COPD and Smokers, respectively. The network can be easily enlarged or reduced. After clicking on a node, the clicked node and its connected nodes are highlighted, and the left part of the network is in greyed out. There are two ways to search this network: “Select by id” for gene names, and “Select by group” for function terms. The searchable function terms correspond to the enriched functions in Table S5. Created with the igraph and visNetwork package in R. [[FigS3.html]]
